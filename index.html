  <h1>Exploring the amount of Screen Time depending on Location and Activity</h1>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Research Question</h2>
    <p>
      How did screen time vary depending on the location and activity during the week and what are the number of sessions per activity?
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Motivation</h2>
    <p> 
      In today's society, digital devices are integrated into our daily lives with our phones being on us at all times. Through this research, we are able to understand how, when and where, we use our devices that can help us reveal important patterns regarding our lifestyles and habits. Especially for young adults and students who suffer from high screen time usage.
    </p> 
    
  </div>
  <div class="section">
    <h2>Audience</h2>
    <p>
      The audience for this visualization is for primarily individuals like myself, who are students and/or young adults, who struggle with excessive screen time usage and are interested in reflecting on and improving their screen time habits. These visualizations will help people become more aware of their bad habits and start to plan on how to combat these habits. It also can serve a broader audience of people who are curious about how environment and activity can influence screen time usage.
    </p>
    </div>
  <div class="section">
    <h2>Description of the Visualization</h2>
    <p>
      My visualization shows how my phone use varied by activity and location throughout the week. I used my phone most at home and during commuting, especially for longer sessions, and much less at school or while exercising. This suggests I use my phone more during unstructured or free time.

    <h2>An Explanation of the Data and Design Decisions You Made</h2>
    <p>
       
      </p>
      I chose a stacked bar chart because it allows me to compare both the total number of screen sessions per activity and the distribution of session lengths in a single view. It doesn't only show how often I used my phone during different activities but also how they varied in amount.
      <p>
      I chose a line chart to visualize total screen time by day of the week because it clearly shows how my phone usage changes over time. The continuous line makes it easy to spot trends, spikes, or drops in screen time across the week that would be harder to interpret with separate bars. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
       I chose a bar chart to show the average daily screen time at each location since it is the most simple way to compare totals across different categories. Each bar represents a location and the height of the bar makes it easy to see which places are associated with more or less screen time.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      One limitation of the project was the number of variables. When collecting data, it was difficult to add more variables because I have never collected data so diligently before and therefore it was difficult to log data accurately. 
      </p>

    <h2>Data Explained </h2>
    <p>
      The stacked bar chart shows how often I used my phone during different activities, broken down by session length. Exercise had the most sessions, but nearly all were short, suggesting focus. Commuting involved only medium sessions, likely due to a limited amount of activities during travel. Studying and lectures had fewer and mostly short sessions, while gaming, eating, and arts and crafts led to longer and more frequent sessions. Overall, unstructured activities resulted in longer screen time, while structured ones limited it.  
    </p>

    <p>
      The line chart plots the total daily screen time across the week for each session type and reveals distinct trends. Medium length sessions were the most consistent throughout the week, peaking sharply on Wednesday (161.5 min), likely due to commuting and free time around a short class day. Long sessions were more prominent on Sunday (125.5 min) and Thursday (94.5 min) suggesting more free time which allows for digital distaction. Short sessions remained stable but spiked on Sunday (35 min) and Thursday (30 min), hinting at more frequent but brief check-ins.
    </p>

<p>
  The bar chart shows that I spent the most daily screen time at home, followed by the subway, gym, and lastly school. Home leads due to unstructured activities like gaming and eating, while the subway reflects long, uninterrupted commutes. Gym usage was moderate, mostly from quick checks, and school had the least screen time due to its structured, focused environment.

    <h2> Future Directions </h2>
    <p> For future directions of this project, we can definitely increase the amount of variables in order to add more depth in the data such as adding the time that I log the sessions and increase the data time range to a few weeks. We can also increase the data set to include other people's screen time in order to make the data much more reliable than relying on one person's habits and lifestyle. </p>
