  <h1>Exploring the amount of Screen Time depending on Location and Activity</h1>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Research Question</h2>
    <p>
      How did screen time vary depending on the location and activity during the week and what are the number of sessions per activity?
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Motivation</h2>
    <p> 
      In today's society, digital devices are deeply integrated into our daily lives with our phones being on our persons at all times. Through this research, we are able to understand how, when, and where we use our devices which can help us reveal important patterns regarding our lifestyles and habits. Especially for students and young adults, there can be underlying habits that can show through screen usage. For example, students may not be balancing productive screen use and recreational use which can signficantly affect academic performance, mental health and their time management skills.

    <h2>Audience</h2>
    <p>
      The audience for this visualization is for primarily individuals like myself, who are students and/or young adults, who struggle with excessive screen time usage and are interested in reflecting on and improving their screen time habits. These visualizations will help people become more aware of their bad habits and start to plan on how to combat these habits. It also can serve a broader audience of people who are curious about how environment and activity can influence screen time usage.

    <h2>Description of the Visualization</h2>
    <p>
      My visualization shows how my phone use changed depending on what I was doing and where I was during the week. It breaks down the number and length of phone sessions for each activity, shows how much time I spent on my phone each day, and compares average screen time at different locations like home, school, and the subway. The most important things I found are that I used my phone the most at home and during commuting, especially for longer sessions, and much less while at school or exercising. This suggests that the more free or unstructured time I have, the more likely I am to spend time on my phone.

    <h2>An Explanation of the Data and Design Decisions You Made</h2>
    <p>
       
      </p>
      I chose a stacked bar chart because it allows me to compare both the total number of screen sessions per activity and the distribution of session lengths in a single view. It doesn't only show how often I used my phone during different activities but also how they varied in amount.
      <p>
      I chose a line chart to visualize total screen time by day of the week because it clearly shows how my phone usage changes over time. The continuous line makes it easy to spot trends, spikes, or drops in screen time across the week that would be harder to interpret with separate bars. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
       I chose a bar chart to show the average daily screen time at each location since it is the most simple way to compare totals across different categories. Each bar represents a location and the height of the bar makes it easy to see which places are associated with more or less screen time.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      One limitation of the project was the number of variables. When collecting data, it was difficult to add more variables because I have never collected data so diligently before and therefore it was difficult to log data accurately. 
      </p>

    <h2>Data Explained </h2>
    <p>
      In the stacked bar chart, it illustrates how often I used my phone during different activities over the course of a week and breaks those sessions down into 3 categories by duration. Exercise had the highest number of sessions overall which was 44 but nearly all of them were short. This suggests that I was present in the gym instead of being distracted. Commuting had a high number of sessions (31) where all of them were medium length. This is reasonable since there are very little activities to occupy yourself with while commuting. Studying sessions were mostly short which a few longer and medium ones. This implies periodic checking or breaks. Activities such as gaming, eating, and arts and crafts showed more long and medium sessions, indicating prolonged distractions during those activities. However, lectures and studying had fewer and mostly short sessions, showing focus and no distraction. Overall, unstructured activities tend to lead to longer screentime.  
    </p>

    <p>
      The line chart plots the total daily screen time across the week for each session type and reveals distinct trends. Medium length sessions were the most consistent throughout the week, peaking sharply on Wednesday (161.5 min), likely due to commuting and free time around a short class day. Long sessions were more prominent on Sunday (125.5 min) and Thursday (94.5 min) suggesting more free time which allows for digital distaction. Short sessions remained stable but spiked on Sunday (35 min) and Thursday (30 min), hinting at more frequent but brief check-ins.
    </p>

<p>
  The bar chart compares the average daily screen time by location and it shows that I spent the most time on my phone at home, followed by Subway, then the gym and the finally school. Home is the dominating category, most likely due to the freedom and comfort of an unstructured environment where I engage in activities like gaming, eating, or relaxing. The subway comes next, reflecting my long commutes, which provide uninterrupted time ideal for phone use. Gym sessions show moderate screen time, mostly from short interactions between exercises. School had the lowest average daily usage, which is aligned with the idea that the structured and focused nature of lectures limit the phone use.

    <h2> Future Directions </h2>
    <p> For future directions of this project, we can definitely increase the amount of variables in order to add more depth in the data such as adding the time that I log the sessions and increase the data time range to a few weeks. We can also increase the data set to include other people's screen time in order to make the data much more reliable than relying on one person's habits and lifestyle. </p>
